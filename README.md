- npm init
- npm install cypress
- npm install @badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor
- npm install @badeball/cypress-esbuild-preprocessor

Run tests with 
- npx cypress open 


Notes:
Api testing are running well. Ui test sometimes does not run well due to A/B testing and some time issues and prompts (I didn't get it fixed in time and there are still some things to improve)
